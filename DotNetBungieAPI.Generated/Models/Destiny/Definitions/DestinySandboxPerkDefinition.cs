///     What Perks often don't have is human readable information, so we attempt to reverse engineer that by pulling that data from places that uniquely refer to these perks: namely, Talent Nodes and Plugs. That only gives us a subset of perks that are human readable, but those perks are the ones people generally care about anyways. The others are left as a mystery, their true purpose mostly unknown and undocumented.
