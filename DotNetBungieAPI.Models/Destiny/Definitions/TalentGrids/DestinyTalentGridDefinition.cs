///     The time has unfortunately come to talk about Talent Grids.
///     <para />
///     Talent Grids are the most complex and unintuitive part of the Destiny Definition data. Grab a cup of coffee before
///     we begin, I can wait.
///     <para />
///     Talent Grids were the primary way that items could be customized in Destiny 1. In Destiny 2, for now, talent grids
///     have become exclusively used by Subclass/Build items: but the system is still in place for it to be used by items
///     should the direction change back toward talent grids.
///     <para />
///     Talent Grids have Nodes: the visual circles on the talent grid detail screen that have icons and can be activated
///     if you meet certain requirements and pay costs. The actual visual data and effects, however, are driven by the
///     "Steps" on Talent Nodes. Any given node will have 1:M of these steps, and the specific step that will be considered
///     the "current" step (and thus the dictator of all benefits, visual state, and activation requirements on the Node)
///     will almost always not be determined until an instance of the item is created. This is how, in Destiny 1, items
///     were able to have such a wide variety of what users saw as "Perks": they were actually Talent Grids with nodes that
///     had a wide variety of Steps, randomly chosen at the time of item creation.
///     <para />
///     Now that Talent Grids are used exclusively by subclasses and builds, all of the properties within still apply: but
///     there are additional visual elements on the Subclass/Build screens that are superimposed on top of the talent
///     nodes. Unfortunately, BNet doesn't have this data: if you want to build a subclass screen, you will have to provide
///     your own "decorative" assets, such as the visual connectors between nodes and the fancy colored-fire-bathed
///     character standing behind the nodes.
///     <para />
///     DestinyInventoryItem.talentGrid.talentGridHash defines an item's linked Talent Grid, which brings you to this
///     definition that contains enough satic data about talent grids to make your head spin. These *must* be combined with
///     instanced data - found when live data returns DestinyItemTalentGridComponent - in order to derive meaning. The
///     instanced data will reference nodes and steps within these definitions, which you will then have to look up in the
///     definition and combine with the instanced data to give the user the visual representation of their item's talent
///     grid.
