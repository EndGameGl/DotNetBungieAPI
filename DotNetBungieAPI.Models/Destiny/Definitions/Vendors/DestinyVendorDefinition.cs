///     These are the definitions for Vendors.
///     <para />
///     In Destiny, a Vendor can be a lot of things - some things that you wouldn't expect, and some things that you don't
///     even see directly in the game. Vendors are the Dolly Levi of the Destiny universe.
///     <para />
///     - Traditional Vendors as you see in game: people who you come up to and who give you quests, rewards, or who you
///     can buy things from.
///     <para />
///     - Kiosks/Collections, which are really just Vendors that don't charge currency (or charge some pittance of a
///     currency) and whose gating for purchases revolves more around your character's state.
///     <para />
///     - Previews for rewards or the contents of sacks. These are implemented as Vendors, where you can't actually
///     purchase from them but the items that they have for sale and the categories of sale items reflect the rewards or
///     contents of the sack. This is so that the game could reuse the existing Vendor display UI for rewards and save a
///     bunch of wheel reinvention.
///     <para />
///     - Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster. Vendors can have "acceptedItem" buckets that determine
///     the source and destination buckets for transfers. When you interact with such a vendor, these buckets are what gets
///     shown in the UI instead of any items that the Vendor would have for sale. Yep, the Vault is a vendor.
///     <para />
///     It is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more features in the future. They have come to be seen
///     more as generic categorized containers for items than "vendors" in a traditional sense, for better or worse.
///     <para />
///     Where possible and time allows, we'll attempt to split those out into their own more digestible derived
///     "Definitions": but often time does not allow that, as you can see from the above ways that vendors are used which
///     we never split off from Vendor Definitions externally.
///     <para />
///     Since Vendors are so many things to so many parts of the game, the definition is understandably complex. You will
///     want to combine this data with live Vendor information from the API when it is available.
