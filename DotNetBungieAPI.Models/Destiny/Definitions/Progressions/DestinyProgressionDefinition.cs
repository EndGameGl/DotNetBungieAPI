/// <summary>
///     A "Progression" in Destiny is best explained by an example.
///     <para />
///     A Character's "Level" is a progression: it has Experience that can be earned, levels that can be gained, and is
///     evaluated and displayed at various points in the game. A Character's "Faction Reputation" is also a progression for
///     much the same reason.
///     <para />
///     Progression is used by a variety of systems, and the definition of a Progression will generally only be useful if
///     combining with live data (such as a character's DestinyCharacterProgressionComponent.progressions property, which
///     holds that character's live Progression states).
///     <para />
///     Fundamentally, a Progression measures your "Level" by evaluating the thresholds in its Steps (one step per level,
///     except for the last step which can be repeated indefinitely for "Levels" that have no ceiling) against the total
///     earned "progression points"/experience. (for simplicity purposes, we will henceforth refer to earned progression
///     points as experience, though it need not be a mechanic that in any way resembles Experience in a traditional
///     sense).
///     <para />
///     Earned experience is calculated in a variety of ways, determined by the Progression's scope. These go from looking
///     up a stored value to performing exceedingly obtuse calculations. This is why we provide live data in
///     DestinyCharacterProgressionComponent.progressions, so you don't have to worry about those.
