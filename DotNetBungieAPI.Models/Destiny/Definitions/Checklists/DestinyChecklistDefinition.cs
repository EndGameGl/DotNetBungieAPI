/// <summary>
///     By public demand, Checklists are loose sets of "things to do/things you have done" in Destiny that we were actually
///     able to track. They include easter eggs you find in the world, unique chests you unlock, and other such data where
///     the first time you do it is significant enough to be tracked, and you have the potential to "get them all".
///     <para />
///     These may be account-wide, or may be per character.The status of these will be returned in related "Checklist" data
///     coming down from API requests such as GetProfile or GetCharacter.
///     <para />
///     Generally speaking, the items in a checklist can be completed in any order: we return an ordered list which only
///     implies the way we are showing them in our own UI, and you can feel free to alter it as you wish.
///     <para />
///     Note that, in the future, there will be something resembling the old D1 Record Books in at least some vague
///     form.When that is created, it may be that it will supercede much or all of this Checklist data. It remains to be
///     seen if that will be the case, so for now assume that the Checklists will still exist even after the release of D2:
///     Forsaken.
