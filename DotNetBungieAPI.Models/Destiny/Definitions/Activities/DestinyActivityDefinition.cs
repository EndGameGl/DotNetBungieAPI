///     is "Playing".
///     <para />
///     In most PvE activities, this is fairly straightforward. A Story Activity can only be played in the Story Activity
///     Mode.
///     <para />
///     However, in PvP activities, the Activity alone only tells you the map being played, or the Playlist that the user
///     chose to enter.You'll need to know the Activity Mode they're playing to know that they're playing Mode X on Map Y.
///     Activity Definitions tell a great deal of information about what *could* be relevant to a user: what rewards they
///     can earn, what challenges could be performed, what modifiers could be applied.To figure out which of these
///     properties is actually live, you'll need to combine the definition with "Live" data from one of the Destiny
///     endpoints.
///     <para />
///     Activities also have Activity Types, but unfortunately in Destiny 2 these are even less reliable of a source of
///     information than they were in Destiny 1. I will be looking into ways to provide more reliable sources for type
///     information as time goes on, but for now we're going to have to deal with the limitations. See
