///     I see you've come to find out more about Talent Nodes. I'm so sorry. Talent Nodes are the conceptual, visual nodes
///     that appear on Talent Grids. Talent Grids, in Destiny 1, were found on almost every instanced item: they had Nodes
///     that could be activated to change the properties of the item. In Destiny 2, Talent Grids only exist for
///     Builds/Subclasses, and while the basic concept is the same (Nodes can be activated once you've gained sufficient
///     Experience on the Item, and provide effects), there are some new concepts from Destiny 1. Examine
///     DestinyTalentGridDefinition and its subordinates for more information. This is the "Live" information for the
///     current status of a Talent Node on a specific item. Talent Nodes have many Steps, but only one can be active at any
///     one time: and it is the Step that determines both the visual and the game state-changing properties that the Node
///     provides. Examine this and DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition carefully. *IMPORTANT NOTE* Talent Nodes are,
///     unfortunately, Content Version DEPENDENT. Though they refer to hashes for Nodes and Steps, those hashes are not
///     guaranteed to be immutable across content versions. This is a source of great exasperation for me, but as a result
///     anyone using Talent Grid data must ensure that the content version of their static content matches that of the
///     server responses before showing or making decisions based on talent grid data.
