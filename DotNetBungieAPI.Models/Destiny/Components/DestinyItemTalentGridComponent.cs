///     The good news is that they're pretty much only being used for certain base information on items and for
///     Builds/Subclasses. The bad news is that they still suck. If you really want this information, grab this component.
///     <para />
///     An important note is that talent grids are defined as such:
///     <para />
///     A Grid has 1:M Nodes, which has 1:M Steps.
///     <para />
///     Any given node can only have a single step active at one time, which represents the actual visual contents and
///     effects of the Node (for instance, if you see a "Super Cool Bonus" node, the actual icon and text for the node is
///     coming from the current Step of that node).
///     <para />
///     Nodes can be grouped into exclusivity sets *and* as of D2, exclusivity groups (which are collections of exclusivity
///     sets that affect each other).
///     <para />
///     See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for more information. Brace yourself, the water's cold out there in the deep end.
